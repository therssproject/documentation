# Getting Started Guide

Here's a quick guide on how to get started using [therssproject.com](https://therssproject.com) API.

The therssproject API allows to Programmatically and interactively subscribe and consume RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds.

The first step to use the API is to create an account on https://www.therssproject.com. Then an application will be automatically created.

Once we have access to the therssproject dashboard, we need to create an API Key, this key will allow us to communicate with the API. To create a key, visit settings > keys.
Note that there is no need to create an API key if you are planing to create RSS subscriptions only using the dashboard.

To create an RSS subscription an endpoint needs to be created, this endpoint will receive requests with the new RSS entries.
Once the endpoint is created, we can create a subscription specifying this endpoint.

This is all you need to get started.
Happy hacking! 👩🏻‍💻
